For Memoization mostly 2 steps are required
: Add the ans in question bank
: Check if the value persists in qb then return

For Tabulation the iteration method is used
: Step1 : Storage and assign meaning to the cell
: Step2 : Identify direction of problem:
          : where is bigger and smaller problem
          : Solve problem from smaller to bigger one
: Step3 : Travel and solve


public static int MazePath(int[][] ar, int i, int j,int ans){
  : in a function like this:
  the ans returned from base case is always 0 coz base case is looking at initial value of the ans so called.
  //Look at Min cost path for this!! when we return ans as the base case and not the element of ar[n-1][n-1]


Important programs to look at in this to build insight:
MinMoves.java
MinCostPath.java
VarJumpTab.java
ClimbStairsTab.java(study in descending order)



MOST MOST MOST Important
1) jab recursion mein on the way up hai toh peeche waale ka ans next line mein add hoga..naaki ussi line mein

2)jab bhi count += rec(call) and count is defined as int count = 0; within the recursive function;
toh har node ki return hoke value parent ke count ko change karegi and then baaki ki nodes add hongi
