For Memoization mostly 2 steps are required
: Add the ans in question bank
: Check if the value persists in qb then return

For Tabulation the iteration method is used
: Step1 : Storage and assign meaning to the cell
: Step2 : Identify direction of problem:
          : where is bigger and smaller problem
          : Solve problem from smaller to bigger one
: Step3 : Travel and solve


public static int MazePath(int[][] ar, int i, int j,int ans){
  : in a function like this:
  the ans returned from base case is always 0 coz base case is looking at initial value of the ans so called.
  //Look at Min cost path for this!! when we return ans as the base case and not the element of ar[n-1][n-1]


Important programs to look at in this to build insight:
MinMoves.java
MinCostPath.java
VarJumpTab.java
ClimbStairsTab.java(study in descending order)
